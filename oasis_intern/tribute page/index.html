                    <p>
                         Swami Vivekananda, known in his pre-monastic life as Narendra Nath Datta, was born in an
                         affluent family in Kolkata on 12 January 1863. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was a 
                         successful attorney with interests in a wide range of subjects, and his mother, Bhuvaneshwari Devi,
                          was endowed with deep devotion, strong character and other qualities. A precocious boy, Narendra 
                          excelled in music, gymnastics and studies. By the time he graduated from Calcutta University, he had 
                          acquired a vast knowledge of different subjects, especially Western philosophy and history. Born with a yogic 
                          temperament, he used to practise meditation even from his boyhood, and was associated with Brahmo Movement for 
                          some time.

                    <p class="text"><li>Although Narendranath’s mother was a devout woman and he had grown up in a religious atmosphere at home, 
                        he underwent a deep spiritual crisis at the start of his youth. His well-studied knowledge led him to question the 
                        existence of God and for some time he believed in Agnosticism. Yet he could not completely ignore the existence of a 
                        Supreme Being. He became associated with Brahmo Movement led by Keshab Chandra Sen, for some time. The Bramho Samaj 
                        recognised one God unlike the idol-worshipping, superstition-ridden Hinduism</li>
                        <li>Earlier, to satisfy his intellectual quest for God, Narendranath visited prominent spiritual leaders from all religions,
                             asking them a single question, “Have you seen God?” Each time he came away without a satisfying answer. He put forward 
                             the same question to Sri Ramkrishna at his residence in Dakshinewar Kali Temple compounds. Without a moment's hesitation, 
                             Sri Ramakrishna replied: "Yes, I have. I see God as clearly as I see you, only in a much deeper sense." Vivekananda, 
                             initially unimpressed by the simplicity of Ramkrishna, was astonished with Ramakrishna's reply. </li>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                         During the course of his wanderings, he came to know about the World Parliament of Religions being held in Chicago
                        , America in 1893. He was keen to attend the meeting, to represent India, Hinduism and his Guru Sri Ramakrishna’s
                         philosophies. He found assertion of his wishes while he was meditating on the rocks of Kanyakumari, the southernmost
                         tip of India. Money was raised by his disciples in Madras (now Chennai) and Ajit Singh, Raja of Khetri, and Vivekananda
                         left for Chicago on May 31, 1893 from Bombay.
                    </p>
                    <p>He faced insurmountable hardships on his way to Chicago, but his spirits remained as indomitable as ever. On 11 September 
                        1893, when the time came, he took the stage and stunned everyone with his opening line “My brothers and sisters of America”.
                         He received a standing ovation from the audience for the opening phrase. He went on to describe the principles of Vedanta 
                         and their spiritual significance, putting Hinduism on the map of World Religions.

                    In June 1899 he went to the West on a second visit. This time he spent most of his time in the West coast of USA. 
                    After delivering many lectures there, he returned to Belur Math in December 1900. The rest of his life was spent in India, 
                    inspiring and guiding people, both monastic and lay. Incessant work, especially giving lectures and inspiring people, 
                    told upon Swamiji’s health. His health deteriorated and the end came quietly on the night of 4 July 1902. Before his 
                    Mahasamadhi he had written to a Western follower: “It may be that I shall find it good to get outside my body, to cast 
                    it off like a worn out garment. But I shall not cease to work. I shall inspire men everywhere until the whole world shall 
                    know that it is one with God.”
